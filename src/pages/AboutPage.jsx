      <p>Born and raised in Umoja Estate, Eastlands, Acense is a rapper whose music is as gritty and raw as the streets that shaped him. His journey into music started with the eclectic sounds around him—his father bumping old-school rap legends like Tupac, Nas, and DMX, and his mother, a talented poet and teacher, spinning lyrical magic through her plays and poetry.

Before going solo, Acense was part of TNM (Team No Money), a rap crew with four boys from high school. But as life often does, the group disbanded after graduation, and everyone chased their own dreams. That’s when Acense stepped into his own spotlight. Armed with a song he wrote back in high school called "Underground Rapper," he earned respect and his title as the "Underground Rapper" at his university.

His debut single, Babyface Savage (2022), might not have set the charts on fire (56 Spotify streams, to be exact), but it lit a fire within him. He followed it up with his first EP OMO (On My Own), featuring collaborations with Dice Mane and Tyrell Dolla—both high school homies. Tyrell Dolla, the EP's producer and Acense’s long-time vocal coach, traded his mic for mixing desks, though Acense swears Tyrell is still a better rapper than producer.

By 2023, singles like GOD Freestyle and Loyal had grown his fan base, and in early 2024, Acense took things up a notch with Chini Ya Wabling, his first-ever music video on YouTube. The track gained more than 1k Spotify streams in its first week, marking the beginning of his rise.

Currently, Acense and Dice Mane have teamed up for a joint EP—a fusion of dancehall, afrobeats, and Kenyan street slang (Swahili and Sheng), giving listeners a uniquely African vibe.

With his roots grounded in Umoja's grit and his sights set on global stages, Acense is the artist you never saw coming—but you won’t forget.</p>
