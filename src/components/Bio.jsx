        <p className='text-white w-4/5 flex mb-8 text-lg'>Born and raised in Umoja, Nairobi, Acense brings the raw energy of Eastlands to his music, blending old-school rap influences from legends like Tupac and Nas with his own Kenyan flavor. From his high school rap crew to going solo with tracks like Babyface Savage and Chini Ya Wabling, Acense is carving his path in the underground scene. His mix of authenticity and lyrical grit has earned him respectâ€”and there's more to come.</p>
